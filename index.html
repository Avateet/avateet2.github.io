    <h2>My Goal</h2>
    <p>After high school, I want to <strong>try to become a programmer</strong>. Programming allows me to use <em>computing devices</em>, <em>computer networks</em>, and data to solve real-world problems.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Unit 1 -->
  <section>
    <h2>Unit 1: Data</h2>
    <p>
      Data is the foundation of computing. It can be represented in many forms, stored, and transmitted
      across devices. Here are some key terms from Unit 1:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bit:</strong> A binary digit, either 0 or 1.</li>
      <li><strong>Byte:</strong> A sequence of 8 bits.</li>
      <li><strong>Roundoff:</strong> Error that results when the number of bits is not enough to represent the number with full precision.</li>
      <li><strong>Analog Data:</strong> Values that change smoothly over time (e.g., pitch and volume of music).</li>
      <li><strong>Lossless:</strong> Compressing data without losing any information.</li>
      <li><strong>Lossy:</strong> Compressing data by removing some details, making exact recovery impossible.</li>
      <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> Data about data, like descriptive information about a file.</li>
      <li><strong>Physical Network:</strong> The hardware and physical connections that carry internet signals.</li>
      <li><strong>Internet Protocol (IP):</strong> Assigns unique IP addresses to devices and determines how data is routed between them.</li>
      <li><strong>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):</strong> Ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data packets. </li>
      <li><strong>User Datagram Protocol (UDP):</strong> A lightweight alternative to TCP with minimal error-checking (faster but less reliable).</li>
      <li><strong>Packets:</strong> Small chunks of data into which larger messages are divided for transmission. Packets may arrive in order, out-of-order, or not at all.</li>
      <li><strong>Routers:</strong> Specialized computers that forward data across networks, choosing the fastest available path.</li>
      <li><strong>Domain Name System (DNS):</strong> Translates human-readable domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses.</li>
      <li><strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):</strong> Used for transmitting and requesting web pages and media on the World Wide Web.</li>
      <li><strong>World Wide Web (WWW):</strong> A system of linked pages, media, and files browsable over HTTP.</li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h2>Unit 2: Computer Systems and Networks</h2>
    <p>
      The internet connects billions of devices worldwide. Messages are broken into packets, which
      travel across different paths. Protocols and redundancy keep systems reliable and scalable.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Computing Device:</strong> A physical device that can run a program (e.g., computer, smartphone, smart sensor).</li>
      <li><strong>Computer Network:</strong> A group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data.</li>
      <li><strong>Path:</strong> The series of connections between computing devices on a network, starting with the sender and ending with the receiver.</li>
      <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> An agreed-upon set of rules that specify how systems behave and communicate.</li>
      <li><strong>Fault Tolerant:</strong> A system’s ability to continue functioning even if individual components fail.</li>
      <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The ability of a system to expand or contract to meet new demands.</li>
      <li><strong>Bandwidth:</strong> The maximum transmission capacity of a system, measured by bit rate (bits per second).</li>
      <li><strong>URL:</strong> An easy-to-remember web address (e.g., www.example.com).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How the Internet Works</h2>
    <p>Here’s a short video that explains how the internet really works behind the scenes:</p>

  <!-- Digital Divide -->
  <section>
    <h2>Digital Divide</h2>
    <p>
      Digital Divide is the gap between those who have access to the internet/technology and those who don’t. 
      The Digital Divide is most prevalent in countries with low internet infrastructure and affordability – 
      the Sub-Saharan African region has very limited access to the internet. 
      The Digital Divide can affect many people’s lives since those who have access to the internet are able to get educated, 
      while those who don’t have access will have little to no education and may not be able to have a profession, or even be literate.
